# fernet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dreid/fernet-clj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dreid/fernet-clj)

A Clojure implementation of [fernet](https://github.com/fernet/spec).

Fernet's goal is to provide simple and sane authenticated symmetric encryption.

fernet-clj currently supports version ``0x80`` of the fernet specification.

## Usage

First, if you use leiningen, add the following to your dependencies:

[![Latest Version](https://clojars.org/fernet/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/fernet)

To encrypt some data we must generate a key:

```clojure
user=> (require 'fernet.core)
nil
user=> (def k (fernet.core/generate-key))
#'user/k
user=> k
"n7i7vTDV5pXGYRyyYznsUDydOi8KJLTiIX1kUTSfxr0"
```

Fernet keys are defined as a 128-bit signing key and a 128-bit encryption key
that have been URL-safe base64 encoded. ``fernet.core/generate-key`` returns a
randomly generated key of this form as a string.

Once you have a key you can encrypt some messages:

```clojure
user=> (def m (byte-array (map byte "Hello, world!")))
#'user/m
user=> m
#<byte[] [B@5502abdb>
(def token (fernet.core/encrypt k m))
user=> (def token (fernet.core/encrypt k m))
#'user/token
user=> token
"gAAAAABSlDV-AteaTbF7zoG4IFmRxAdyXrgONgSbsQ_FHTnvv2tJCAs4WSJPXa5Ai3OnUSqjSmjX5VH8Ka5G9EOXLaRw3Er5Qg"
```

``fernet.core/encrypt`` returns a Fernet `token` which is a URL-safe base64
encoded series of bytes according to the spec and depending on version.
Generally it includes a verions identifier, followed by an iv, a timestamp,
the ciphertext, and an HMAC over the preceding fields.

They can of course be decrypted with the same key:

```clojure
user=> (def out-m (fernet.core/decrypt k token))
#'user/out-m
user=> out-m
#<byte[] [B@22adc446>
user=> (String. out-m)
"Hello, world!"
```

The timestamp contained in the Fernet `token` is the time at which the token
was generated.  ``fernet.core/decrypt`` takes a ``:ttl`` argument which will
cause it to reject any token that is older than the specified number of
seconds.

```clojure
user=> (Thread/sleep 5000)
nil
user=> (fernet.core/decrypt k token :ttl 5)

ExceptionInfo Invalid token.  clojure.core/ex-info (core.clj:4327)
```
